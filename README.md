# MoneyMatters
Is doing your budgeting keeping you up at nights? Has keeping track of those bills been driving you crazy? Is having to ask a friend to pay back the money you lent them on the top of your ‘that awkward moment’ list? Well, now you can relax. Money Matters will take care of it all for you.

Money matters is a budgeting app to help you track your daily/weekly/monthly expenses and bills. The app provides an easy to use interface to monitor your spendings by setting a spend limit on your day/week/month and notifies you when you overshoot the limits. The user can separate his/her expenses into different categories when feeding them into the
app. It gets rid of the awkward situation of having to ask your friends to pay you back the money you’ve lent them by sending them periodic notifications. You can also get regular expense tracking statements and view the statistics in the form of graphs.
